# How to Contribute

Its pretty easy. You don't need to ask for access or anything as the repository is available for anyone to read and contribute. You can do one of two things:

1. You can create what is called a **Pull Request** to modify a file directly with your changes and be subject for approval by Darkhawk02 and TwinShadow. or:
2. You can simply create an Issue Ticket in the Tracker and suggest changes that way. One can use this to submit bug reports as well or translation improvements.

If you're not sure about what to do, you can get in touch with Darkhawk02 or TwinShadow via email or Discord if you wish. You can open up a ticket in the Issue Tracker if you'd like things to be easier for you. You will need a GitHub account though to do either of the actions above.
